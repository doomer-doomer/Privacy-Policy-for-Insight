# Privacy Policy for Insight 
*Last Updated: February 14, 2025*  

## **1. Introduction**  
This Privacy Policy outlines how Insight ("the App") collects, uses, and protects information in compliance with global privacy standards (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). The App aggregates news articles from proper available sources of third-party API, generates AI-powered summaries using tools like Google Gemini and displays content to users. No personal data is collected without explicit user consent.  

## **2. Data Collection and Use**  
### **Non-Personal Data**  
- **News Content**: The App gathers news articles and metadata (headlines, authors, publication dates) from Newsapi.org.  
- **AI Processing**: Summaries are generated using AI models (e.g., Gemini), which analyze the actual content. Gemini does not use user inputs or outputs for model training without explicit permission.  
- **Performance Analytics**: Aggregated, anonymized data (e.g., app usage, crash reports) is collected to improve functionality.  

### **Personal Data**  
- **Optional Permissions**: The App may request access to location data or notifications **only with user consent**.  
- **Advertisements**: Third-party ads may use non-personal identifiers (e.g., device type, IP address) for targeting. No sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII) is shared with advertisers.  

## **3. AI and Scraping Practices**  
- **Data Sources**: Articles are sourced from Newsapi.org. The App avoids scraping password-protected or sensitive content.  
- **AI Summaries**: Summaries are generated using Gemini and similar models. These models are trained on publicly available data and do not retain user-specific inputs.  
- **Accuracy Disclaimer**: AI-generated summaries may contain inaccuracies. Users are advised to verify critical information with original sources.  

## **4. Third-Party Services**  
- **Ad Networks**: Ads are served via third-party providers (e.g., Google AdMob). These services may collect anonymized data for ad personalization. Users can opt out via device settings or ad network policies.  
- **AI Providers**: Gemini and other AI tools comply with strict data governance standards. For example, Gemini does not store prompts or responses beyond the session duration unless explicitly permitted.  

## **5. Data Security**  
- **Encryption**: All data transmissions are encrypted in transit (HTTPS/TLS).  
- **Access Controls**: Strict internal protocols limit data access to authorized personnel.  
- **Retention**: Scraped articles are cached for up to 30 days; anonymized analytics are retained for 12 months.  

## **6. User Rights**  
- **Access/Deletion**: Users can request access to or deletion of their data via theinsight.contactus@gmail.com.  
- **Opt-Out**: Disable ad personalization or data collection through app settings.  
- **Complaints**: Raise concerns with regulatory authorities (e.g., GDPR supervisory bodies).  

## **7. Childrenâ€™s Privacy**  
The App does not target users under 13. No PII is knowingly collected from minors without parental consent.  

## **8. Policy Updates**  
Changes to this policy will be notified via in-app alerts or email. Continued use constitutes acceptance of revised terms.  

## **9. Contact Information**

### **Additional Clauses**  
- **No Sale of Data**: The App does not sell user data to third parties.  
- **Compliance**: Adheres to GDPR, CCPA, and other applicable regulations.  
- **Open-Source Tools**: Where applicable, scraping uses tools like Page2API or Relevance AI to ensure ethical data extraction.
